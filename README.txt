#COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview:

This project analyzes worldwide COVID-19 data to explore trends, identify hotspots, and compare country-wise cases. Using Python and data visualization libraries, it provides insights into the spread of COVID-19.

---

## Dataset

-**File**: covid_19_clean_complete.csv

-**Description**: 
Contains date-wise records of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for multiple countries.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data.

- Visualize daily and cumulative case counts.

- Compare country-wise trends.

- Highlight top affected countries and time trends.

---

##Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x

- Pandas (data cleaning and manipulation)

- Matplotlib (data visualization)

- Seaborn (statistical graphics)

- Jupyter Notebook (interactive development)

---

## How to Run

1.	Clone or download this repository.

2. Open covid_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

3.  Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

---

##Results:

- Time-series plots showing the progression of COVID-19.

- Country-wise bar charts and line graphs.

- Insights into trends and affected regions.

---

##Future Enhancements

- Add machine learning models to forecast future case counts.

- Build an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis.
